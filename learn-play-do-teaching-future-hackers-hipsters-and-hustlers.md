*Over the weekend of March 2nd and 3rd,* PantherHackers worked with Georgia State's Alonzo A. Crim Center for Urban Education Excellence to put on a mini-hackathon for elementary students in the Atlanta area called Learn Play Do.

The event is intdented to initiate students grades K-12 into the world of technology. While the event was the first of its kind here at Georgia State, PantherHackers who attended the event loved it:



The elementary school children started pouring in around 9 AM. After the indroductions by Dana, they went on their way to watch a presentation on sound and music put on by Dr. Brian "Mr. Science" Williams. The presentation capitvated the kids and mentors alike. Mr. Science talked about how sound travels and let the kids play different tunes by hitting pipes of different sizes to play different pitches.


Later the grade schoolers had time to work with their PantherHackers mento:rs and go through the ideation process to develop an app related to music.
App ideas ranged from "choosing one song's lyrics and another's rythm and then using autotune to combine the two", to a social song creation website.







The next Learn Play Do is set for the 2017 fall semester and you can be sure that PantherHackers will be there.
